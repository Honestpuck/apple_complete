## bash completion for Apple tools

These are a number of scripts designed to add programmable completion to `bash` for
some of the command line tools 
They complete the options for each tool, the completion cuts in after `-` or `--`.

If you have installed bash completion using `brew` then drop the files
into `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/` (or link them) and open a new Terminal window.

Feedback, bug reports and comments would be greatly appreciated.
